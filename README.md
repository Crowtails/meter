# About tos
Pann - Director of Community - ArtCraft Developer on an other tool: "He is reading the combat log. (So if we change the combat logs that we output it might break his overlay.) But from his description it doesn't sound like it is giving the players tactical advantages or anything."

Jack Kirby (Crowfall) - Jun 11, 2020, 12:06:08 PM GMT-5 : So long as the tool is only reading our logs, it should be perfectly fine as far as the ToS goes! Let us know if you need anything else.

# how does it work
   Crowtails reads [Crowfall](https://crowfall.com/en-US/) official log-files. All data collected is saved into a local database.
   If you join a group, those log-file-data will be transmittet to firebase by google and all group 
   members.
   The application does not send usage/user statistics of any kind.
   If you are a guild leader, you should consider to create a firebase account with realtime db to share dps data.
